# RoboFont Helpers

Various scripts that are helpful for working in [RoboFont](https://www.robofont.com). Not a comprehensive set, by any means. Mostly, these are small utility scripts that can be handy.

A few are written by other people, and I try to always indicate when that is the case.

No warranties of any kind. Some of the code is a bit messy. Always use version control and/or backups when using scripts! They may not do what you expect or want, and it is important to check the results.

Happy RoboFonting!
